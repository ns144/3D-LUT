# Working with unpaired data: 3D LUT generation with a GAN

After we have shown that it is possible to learn 3D LUTs with a CNN in  the previous experiment we want to learn the style translation between  images of different analog films with 3D LUTs. In the first attempt of  this style translation, we are going to use a generative adversarial  network (GAN).

- In [Img2LUT_GAN.ipynb](https://github.com/ns144/3D-LUT/blob/main/02_GAN_Img2LUT/Img2LUT_GAN.ipynb) we implemented and trained our GAN
- In [01_Val_GAN_BW_Models.ipynb](https://github.com/ns144/3D-LUT/blob/main/02_GAN_Img2LUT/01_Val_GAN_BW_Models.ipynb) we evaluate the trained model
