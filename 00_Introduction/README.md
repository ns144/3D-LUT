# Introduction

3D Look Up Tables (LUT)s are a common method to transform the colors of an images globally. 

[01_3D_LUT.ipynb](https://github.com/ns144/3D-LUT/blob/main/00_Introduction/01_3D_LUT.ipynb) offers an introduction on how 3D LUTs work in practice.

In [02_Apply_3D_LUT.ipynb](https://github.com/ns144/3D-LUT/blob/main/00_Introduction/02_Apply_3D_LUT.ipynb) we are going to explain how we created a method to apply 3D LUTs with a differentiable function efficiently to RGB images.
